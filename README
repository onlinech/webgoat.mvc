WebGoat.MVC

WebGoat is a deliberately insecure ASP.NET MVC web application maintained by OWASP designed to teach web application security 
lessons. In each scenario, users learn their their understanding of a security issue by exploiting a real vulnerability in the 
WebGoat application. 

This is based on the OWASP web goat Project
